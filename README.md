# BPtimer - Balanced Practice Timer

A comprehensive meditation app for balanced practice with formal sessions and daily mindfulness reminders.

This is a monorepo containing every part of BPtimer:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `mobile/` | **The BPtimer app** — Flutter (Android/iOS/desktop). This is the current, primary product. |
| `/` (root) | The original web prototype (PWA) that the app was built from. Still live as a web demo at https://odcpw.github.io/bptimer/ |
| `privacy/` | The privacy policy, live at https://odcpw.github.io/bptimer/privacy/ |

> The PWA at the repo root came first and served as the prototype; the Flutter
> app in `mobile/` is the real product it grew into. Previously split across the
> `bptimer`, `bptimer-flutter`, and `bptimer-privacy` repositories; merged here
> with full git history preserved.
