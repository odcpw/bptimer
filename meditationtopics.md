# Meditation Topics

## Mindfulness

### Walking Meditation Instructions
For the formal walking meditation sessions it is often better to limit the length of the walking track to 20-30 paces.

#### Special Hints on Walking Meditation
- **Sleepiness** - walk quicker with broader Awareness
- **Restlessness, lots of thinking** - walk slower, observing changes in sensations of feet and legs (close-up Awareness)  
- **Anger and frustration** - walk more gently and gracefully after observing the result of anger on walking (heavy footsteps)

### Mindfulness & Investigation of Hindrances

#### Basic Approach to Hindrances
**First Note the Hindrance:** "Desire, Desire," "Aversion, Aversion," or more specifically, "Planning, Planning," "Remembering," etc. You may have to note it a few times. Try not to push it away, suppress or indulge it. If it disappears, observe its characteristic of impermanence, and then return to the breath or footsteps.

#### When Strong Attachment Persists
If you have a strong "attachment" and just noting does not help to let it go:

**INVESTIGATE** - Not in a thinking way or by building a story about it, but instead let the hindrance be the object of awareness as it is manifesting in the Body.

After first noting the hindrance, bring the attention to the Body. Observe the sensations of tension, tightness, etc. in the body when strong Aversion, Fear, Worry, Desire, etc. are present. Run the attention through the body, observing all parts of your body, observing areas that have reacted from the thoughts in the mind. Continue observing all areas of tension or uncomfortable sensation. The mind may gradually become interested in the body and become more objective, no longer "feeding" the hindrance or distracting thoughts. No longer feeding thoughts but observing their effect on the body. The Understanding of the unsatisfactoriness of attachment to the hindrance may arise and also Compassion for ourselves. When it passes, return to the breath, walking, etc.

### Working with Unpleasant Physical Sensations
- First try to treat it similar to wandering thoughts
- When aversion develops toward it, then change your attention to the sensation itself
- Soften your awareness around it. Observe its characteristics: size, shape, location, hot, cold, heavy, light, changes in intensity, etc. With an open mind, interested mind: "What is this thing that I normally call pain?"
- When aversion, fear, worry develop strongly toward it, then change your attention to the aversion, fear, worry as they manifest in the body
- Observe the physical reactions throughout the body: tensions, tightening or merely changes in body posture; hands, arms, stomach, chest, neck, face, everywhere. Note and feel the reactions, then try to relax
- When aversions, etc. develop strongly and limits of concentration and energy have come, sit just a little more: one minute, 30 seconds, 10 breaths
- Check sensation, decide if you still wish to move
- Note to yourself, "I feel that I have worked as best I can at this time. Rather than build more and more aversion, I will change my posture and start again on the breathing."
- When changing posture, continue to observe sensation
- When sensation has faded away, start again on observing the breathing
- **Keep in mind: Gently, gently**

### The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipattana Sutta)

#### 1. Mindfulness of the Body
- Breath
- Postures  
- Activities
- Body as a collection of parts - bones, hair, teeth, blood, etc.
- Body manifesting in Four Elements - EARTH, WATER, WIND, FIRE - sensations in the body
- Cemetery contemplation - "Verily my body is of the same nature: such it will become and cannot escape from it."

#### 2. Mindfulness of Vedana (Feeling)
Awareness of a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling arising in the mind due to the contact of the six senses with their object. Watching impermanence of feeling and trying not to react unwisely.

#### 3. Mindfulness of States of Mind
Overall State of Mind through which we color our experience. BARE AWARENESS - watching impermanence.

#### 4. Mindfulness of Mind Objects

**A) Five Hindrances**
Knowing: 1) When they are present; 2) When they are absent; 3) How they arise; 4) How to let go of them if they have arisen; 5) How they won't arise in the future.

**B) Five Aggregates** - the MIND/BODY as a process, arising and passing
1. Body
2. Consciousness (knowing quality of mind arising when the senses come in contact with their objects)
3. Vedana - feeling
4. Perception - labeling process
5. Mental formations - thoughts, emotions

**C) Seven Factors of Enlightenment**
1. Mindfulness
2. Investigation of Mental Objects  
3. Energy
4. Joy
5. Tranquillity
6. Concentration
7. Equanimity

To know: a) when they are present; b) when they are absent; c) how they can arise; d) how to develop them.

**D) Four Noble Truths**
1. Existence of Unsatisfactoriness
2. Cause - ignorance, unwise reaction and craving
3. Fading away - developing WISDOM, giving up unwise reaction and craving
4. How to do it - the Path - methods of Mental Development

## Compassion/Lovingkindness

### Compassion/Lovingkindness Meditation
Two ways of phrasing the Compassion Lovingkindness wish used by Steve and Rosemary:

**Version 1:**
"May _______ be able to learn, practice and develop methods, techniques and tools of mental development, so that _______ can cope with, understand, accept and overcome the difficulties and challenges of life. May _______ find Peace of Mind."

**Version 2:**
"May _______ be able to let go of anger, fear, worry and ignorance. May _______ also have patience, courage, wisdom and determination to meet and overcome difficulties and problems, challenges of life. May _______ find Peace of Mind."

### Many Compassion/Lovingkindness Techniques

**Ten Systematic Approaches:**

1. **Diffusing/Defusing Technique (D/D)** - Take an existing unpleasant emotion for contemplation. Open to the Dukkha. Universalize it by opening to vivid examples of humans or other living beings who may experience these emotions intensely. Try to open out & have Compassion/Lovingkindness to them. e.g. aloneness, rejection. What other Living Beings may be experiencing this?

2. **Choosing a Particular Age** in your life - C/L to yourself, then universalize it - others same age - similar activities.

3. **Going Through Your Life** - C/L for all the people you were - combine it with the Diffusing/Defusing technique to Universalize.

4. **Prior to Going to Sleep** - systematic way:
   - C/L to person you were in the day
   - Closest relative
   - All living beings met in the day
   - A group people from your past
   - A group people from world (e.g. doctors, soldiers etc.)
   - All beings collectively

5. **Everyday Life Activities**
   - Before eating - consider all living beings that may have died or been made to suffer hardship so you could live
   - Before sweeping, cleaning etc. - wish C/L to any beings that may die while you sweep, clean, etc.

6. **Choose Material Object for Deeper Reflection** - Reflect on the dependent arising nature of the object. Trace it back to its origin - consider the living beings that may have died or been made to suffer to make it. C/L to all these beings.

7. **Groups of Countries**, one at a time. Then HUMANITY as a whole. Then self as part of humanity. Then self.

8. **1-10-11-1**: One person similar age, sex, problems; 10 people similar age, sex, problems; 10 people as before plus yourself; yourself alone.

9. **Classify as follows**: no legs, 1 leg, 2 legs, 3 legs, 4 legs, 5, 6, 7, 8,... more than 8 legs, beings with wings, in the ocean, unseen beings. C/L for all.

10. **Waking Up in the Morning** - Identifying with real situations waking up as that person - universalizing it.

### Going Through Your Life Meditation
**Systematic Life Review Process:**
- Start as young as you can remember at home. Think of an occasion where you were with your family. Give yourself a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish. Give your family relatives a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.
- Then at school, kindergarten, pre-school, etc. Think of an occasion where you were doing something with the others. Give yourself a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish. Give your teacher & other students a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.
- Then outside of home or school. Think of an occasion where you were doing something with the others, probably sports or music, etc. Give yourself a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish. Give the others a Compassion/Lovingkindness wish.
- Then one year at a time, first your home, then school or work, then outside activities. Continue until today.

### Forgiveness Meditation

#### Self-Forgiveness Practice
**Preparation:** If death were to come to you tonight, do you have a time in your past which you have not forgiven, resolved, let go of? Is there something you do not want to remember, want to push away?

**Process:**
- Right now, delve into those memories you do not want to remember - but not in order to burn yourself with them. Instead, try to have the intention to learn from them, to forgive yourself
- Let each memory arise by itself, trying to keep the mind soft and open. Not forcing the memory into a chronological order or form. Let any come as it does
- When it does, stop the frame. Focus on the scene. Allow yourself to see it clearly. Do not hide it from yourself
- Now, analyze the person who you were, trying to stay soft and objective, to see the cause behind the actions, speech and thoughts

**Key Questions:**
- What were your beliefs? What were you doing it for?
- Were you clouded in your reasoning?
- Were you swept away with greed, hatred or ignorance? Did you have awareness to protect you?
- What was the result for you or the others in the scene?
- Is that person you were the same as you are today, with the same understanding?

**Forgiveness Phrases:**
- "I forgive the person I was."
- "May I realize the changing nature of the self and not cling to who I have been. May I forgive myself."
- "May I find my way out of darkness to the light of Liberation. May I have the Wisdom and Determination to not cause harm to myself and others."

#### Forgiving Others
- Try to analyze the person they were. Try to stay soft and objective in order to see the cause behind their actions, speech and thoughts
- Were they clouded in their reasoning? Were they swept away with greed, hatred or ignorance?
- Can you understand that they were temporarily blinded by their defilements?
- Can you see them also as part of the cycle of birth, aging and death?
- Can you have Compassion for the Dukkha knowing that they have to reap the results of their Kamma?

**Forgiveness Phrases for Others:**
- "I forgive you."
- "May they find their way out of darkness to the light of Liberation. May they learn to not hurt themselves and others."

#### Universal Forgiveness
Extend forgiveness to all human beings collectively:
- "I forgive human kind."
- "May all human beings find their way out of darkness to the light of Liberation. May they learn to not hurt themselves and others."

### Going to Bed Compassion/Lovingkindness Sequence
**Progressive Circle of Loving-kindness:**
1. Yourself
2. The one person who is closest to you
3. All the different people or beings whom you have had contact with today
4. Any one group of people from your past
5. Any one group of people from the world
6. All beings

### DD (Diffusing-Defusing) Compassion/Lovingkindness
**Systematic Method:**
**Part 1:** Start with yourself, then consider someone else with similar Dukkha who is the same age and same sex, then same age & opposite sex, then add 10 years and both sexes, then go down 10 years and both sexes, continuing until covering all ages from children to elderly.

**Part 2:** Use your own age and sex. Consider many people similar to you but gradually imagine their Dukkha getting more and more intense.

**Purpose:** 
- Shows us we are not alone with our Dukkha
- Helps us see that our Dukkha is not so big compared to others
- Aids in letting go of attachment to our suffering

### "1-10-11-1" Compassion/Lovingkindness Exercise
**Visualization Process:**
1. **One person:** Meet someone your age and sex with similar difficulties who is very sad and upset - develop compassion for them
2. **Ten people:** Join a group of ten people, all with similar problems, all sad and upset - develop compassion for the group
3. **Eleven people:** View all 11 people (including yourself) as a group with similar difficulties - develop compassion for all
4. **One person (yourself):** Return to just yourself, a human being with difficulties - develop self-compassion

### Alternative Compassion/Lovingkindness Phrases
**Traditional Phrasing:**
- May they be free of mental Dukkha
- May they be free of physical Dukkha
- May they come to know inner peace and contentment
- May they be able to lead themselves to the ending of all Dukkha

## Sympathetic Joy

### Sympathetic Joy Meditation
**Sympathetic Joy Wish (Rosemary's phrasing):**
"In times of discouragement, may _______ be able to remember their good qualities. Take Joy with them, in the gradual awakening and their inner potential. Feeling Joy in the teachings, may it give them a refuge, giving them confidence and energy to continue."

**Alternative Sympathetic Joy Wish:**
"May _______ feel happiness within and be able to continue in this way. May _______ be able to make more good decisions in my/their life. And, at moments, if _______ fail in some of them, may _______ remember the times when my/their resolutions were strong. May this make _______ happy so I/they can then try again to succeed in my/their resolutions. This would bring more happiness and joy."

### Alavaka's Questions to the Buddha
**The Questions:**
"What is the best wealth to a person in this world? What is the good practice that brings happiness? What is the sweetest of all tastes? What manner of living is said to be the noblest kind?"

**The Buddha's Replies:**
"Confidence is the best wealth to a person in this world. Well-practiced Dhamma brings the most happiness. Truth is the sweetest of all tastes. Living with wisdom is said to be the noblest kind."

**Further Questions:**
"How does one cross the flood of recurrent birth? How does one cross the seas of existence? How does one transcend unhappiness? How does one get purified?"

**The Buddha's Replies:**
"One crosses the cycles of birth and death by confidence. One crosses the sea of existence by heedfulness. One transcends unhappiness by strenuous effort. One purifies oneself by wisdom."

### The Four Assurances (From Kalama Sutta)
**The Buddha's Teaching:**
"Thus, Kalamas, those disciples of the Noble Ones, who have such a hate-free mind, such a malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind, are ones by whom four assurances are found here and now:

1. **First Assurance:** If there is a world beyond, and there is the fruit and result of Kamma well-done or ill, then at death, at the dissolution of this body, I shall be reborn in a good destination, in a heaven world.

2. **Second Assurance:** If, however, there is no world beyond, and there is no fruit and result of Kamma well-done or ill, yet in this very life I dwell free from hostility and affliction, sorrowless and happy.

3. **Third Assurance:** If ill (results) befall an evil-doer, I, however, think of doing evil to no one. Then, how can ill (results) affect me who does no evil deed?

4. **Fourth Assurance:** If, however, evil (results) do not befall an evil-doer, then I see myself purified in any case."

### Enhanced Dedication Practices
**Dedication of Merits (Extended):**
"May what I have done today to help purify my mind and heart, may it be of some help to benefit all beings."

**Purpose:** This dedication helps to give a sense of contentment and joy with your efforts. You remember that you are not doing this practice just for yourself and your own peace, but also for the benefit and welfare of all beings - through Compassion for the world.

**Usage:** End each day with a similar dedication. For those who are really keen, you could end each formal session with the dedication.

### The Five Reflections
1. How fortunate you are and how precious your opportunity is
2. Death and Impermanence
3. Kamma - the Law of Cause and Effect
4. Dukkha - unsatisfactoriness
5. "To Care and Not to Care" - the relationship between Compassion and Equanimity

#### Extended Reflection Practice Methods

**For "How fortunate you are" reflection:**
Simply reflect on all the different ways that you are fortunate, material and mental. Watch out for the word "but" - it is not part of this reflection.

**For Dukkha (unsatisfactoriness) reflection:**
Think of every single type of Dukkha that you can imagine. Using systems helps:
- The alphabet with occupations: What types of Dukkha can airplane pilots experience?, bankers, cooks, doctors, etc.
- Body parts: What kinds of Dukkha can occur in the toes?, feet, legs, hips, etc.; inside also like cancer, diarrhea, etc.
- Ages: from 1 to 100, What kinds of Dukkha can come for babies, one year olds, two, etc.
- Alphabet with mental Dukkha: anger, boredom, craving, etc.

**For Death & Impermanence reflection:**
Go through systems considering every different way in which one could die.

**For "Actions & the results of Actions" reflection:**
Use "Inward and Outward" approach:
- **Inward:** Look into your past and consider experiences and their results. Learn from beneficial actions to repeat them, and from unbeneficial actions to understand how to do better.
- **Outward:** Look at others and things you have read about or seen. Contemplate how actions were beneficial or unbeneficial and consider what you would do in similar situations.

### The Four Great Efforts
1. The effort to prevent unbeneficial qualities from arising
2. The effort to let go of unbeneficial qualities that have already arisen
3. The effort to develop beneficial qualities
4. The effort to maintain beneficial qualities that have arisen

### The Noble Eightfold Path
1. Right Understanding
2. Right Intention
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Concentration

### Eight Worldly Dhammas Reflection

#### Understanding Praise and Blame
A systematic reflection examining our relationship with external validation and criticism:

**Key Questions for Reflection:**
- In what ways do you get stuck, involved, attached and concerned to wanting Praise?
- In what ways do you get stuck, involved, attached and concerned to not wanting Blame?
- Can you remember times when you received Praise and thought it was very important, making you very happy, yet now you can see it really did not matter?
- Can you remember times when you received Blame and thought it was very important, making you very sad, yet now you can see it really did not matter?

**Deep Investigation:**
- Does their Blame have the power to change your past unbeneficial intention?
- Does their praise have the power to change your past unbeneficial intention?
- Could the pleasant feelings of Praise encourage you to repeat an action based in unbeneficial intention through the wish to receive more pleasant feelings?
- Could the unpleasant feelings of blame encourage you to not repeat a beneficial action?

**The Four Pairs:**
1. **Praise and Blame**
2. **Fame and Obscurity** 
3. **Gain and Loss**
4. **Pleasure and Pain**

For each pair, reflect on attachment patterns and how they block understanding of reality and create more Dukkha.

### Five Daily Recollections
Traditional Buddhist contemplations to be reflected upon regularly:

1. **I am of the nature to decay - I have not gone beyond decay**
2. **I am of the nature to be diseased - I have not gone beyond disease**  
3. **I am of the nature to die - I have not gone beyond death**
4. **All that is mine, dear and delightful, will change and vanish**
5. **I am the owner of my Kamma - I am the heir to my Kamma - I am born of my Kamma - I am related to my Kamma - I abide supported by my Kamma - Of whatever Kamma I shall do, whether wholesome or unwholesome, of that I will be the heir**

### Origination and Dissolution Meditation

#### Material Objects Contemplation
- Think of an external inanimate material object that you like very much - something you feel quite attached to
- Trace this object back in time to see its source
- Break it down into the four elements of earth, water, wind and fire
- Contemplate: Will this object ever change or age? Will it return to Nature? Can you prevent this happening? Is the object really yours?

#### Body Contemplation
- Is your body also composed of these four elements of earth, water, wind and fire?
- Did it also come from Nature?
- Can the body be separated from the four elements of Nature for very long and still survive?
- Has the body ever changed or aged? Will it return to Nature?
- Can the body ultimately be yours?

### Seven Reflections Practice
1. **How fortunate I am**
2. **Death**
3. **Actions and Results of Actions** 
4. **Dukkha**
5. **Impermanence**
6. **No problems, only challenges** - Good luck, bad luck. Who knows? What can I learn from this? Changing everything into the Path
7. **Compassion and Equanimity**
